# CSS

By default, CSS is written with a library we've developed called [shed.css](http://tedconf.github.io/shed-css/). 

When shed.css doesn't cover your needs (look again, it probably does), feel free to drop back into Sass using our [Sass guidelines](https://github.com/tedconf/code-style-guides/blob/master/sass.md).
