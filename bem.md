    .Block-name
    .Block-name__element-name
    .Block-name__element-name--modifier-name


* Block names always start with a capital letter.
* Two underscores are used to adjoin an element.
* Two hyphens are used to adjoin a modifier.
* A single hyphen is used to separate multiple words within block,
  element, and modifier names (i.e., spinal-case).
