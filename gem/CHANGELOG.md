# TED Rubocop Rules

## 1.1.0 - September 21, 2020

Update rubocop to 0.91.0. [#79](https://github.com/tedconf/code-style-guides/pull/79)

## 1.0.0 - June 29, 2020

Initial release of TED's rubocop rules as a ruby gem.

The ruleset itself is unchanged from our previous non-gem process. This is just
a change to how we are packaging and distributing the rules.
