# Common EditorConfig configuration for TED projects

It's recommended that every code project include an `.editorconfig` file and that every developer configure their text editor or IDE to [use EditorConfig.](https://editorconfig.org/#download)

## Goals

[EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org) helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs. While other linters handle language-specific concerns, EditorConfig manages near-universal plain text concerns such as character encoding and line endings and other whitespace. Normalizing these improves readability/maintainability and avoids corruption issues (e.g. with unexpected encodings).

## Usage

Copy this repository's [`.editorconfig`](../../.editorconfig) to your project's root.

[Install and configure an EditorConfig plugin for your preferred text editor or IDE.](https://editorconfig.org/#download)
